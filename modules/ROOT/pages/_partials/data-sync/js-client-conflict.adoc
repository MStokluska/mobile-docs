= Resolving Conflicts on the Client

At a high level, there is a typical flow to resolving conflicts on the client.

. *A Mutation Occurs* - A client tries to modify or delete an object on the server using a GraphQL mutation.
. *Read the Object* - The server reads the current object the client is trying to modify from the data source (usually a database).
. *Conflict Detection* - The server compares the current object with the data sent by the client to see if there was a conflict. If there is a conflict, the server returns a response to the client containing information outlined in <<#error-structure, Structure of the Conflict Error>>
. *Conflict Resolution* - The client attempts to resolve this conflict and makes a new request to the server in the hope that this data is no longer conflicted.

The conflict resolution implementation will require additional elements in your application in order to work:

- A `returnType` added to the context of any mutation. see: <<#working-with-conflicts-client, Working With Conflict Resolution on the Client>>.
- Additional metadata inside types (for example version field) depending on the conflict implementation you chose. see: <<#version-based-conflict, Version Based Conflict Detection>>.
- Server-side resolvers to return conflicts back to clients first. For more information, see: <<#conflict-resolution-{context}, Server Side Conflict Detection>>.

Developers can either use the default conflict resolution implementations, or implement their own ones thanks to the pluggable conflict resolution mechanism. By default when no changes were made on the same fields, the implementation will try to resend the modified payload back to the server. When changes on the server and the client cover the same fields one of the specified conflict resolution strategies can be used. The default strategy will apply client changes on top of the server side data. Developers can modify strategies to suit their needs.

== Working with Conflict Resolution on the Client

To enable conflict resolution we fist need to configure our server side resolvers to perform conflict detection. Detection can rely on many different implementations and return the conflict error back to the client. For more information about how to do this, please see <<#conflict-resolution-{context}, Server Side Conflict Detection>>.

Next, we need to provide mutations with one extra piece of information used to resolve any conflicts. This is done by using the context and the piece of information is a parameter `returnType`. This parameter defines the Object type you are operating on.

If using {sync-service}'s `offlineMutation` you can provide this parameter directly as follows:

[source,javascript]
----
client.offlineMutation({
  ...
  returnType: 'Task'
  ...
})
----

or if using Apollo's mutate function:

[source,javascript]
----
client.mutate({
  ...
  context: {
    returnType: 'Task'
  }
  ...
})
----

The client will then automatically resolve them based on the current strategy and notify listeners if the developer supplied any.

Conflict resolution will work out of the box with the recommended defaults and does not require any specific handling on the client.

> For advanced use cases developers may customize their conflict implementation by supplying a custom `conflictProvider` in their application config. See <<#conflict-resolution-strategies,Conflict Resolution Strategies>> below.

== Default Conflict Implementation

By default, conflict resolution is configured to rely on a `version` field on each GraphQL type. A version field will also need to be saved to the database in order to detect changes on the server.

For example:

[source,javascript]
----
type User {
  id: ID!
  version: String!
  name: String!
}
----

The version field is controlled on the server and will map the last version that was sent from the server. All operations on the version field happen automatically, however, users need to make sure that the version field is always passed to the server for mutations that supports conflict resolution:

[source,javascript]
----
type Mutation {
  updateUser(id: ID!, version: String!): User
}
----

Alternatively developers can create input elements that can be reused in every mutation and support conflict resolution.

[source,javascript]
----
type Mutation {
  updateUser(user: UserInput): User
}
----

[#conflict-resolution-strategies]
== Conflict Resolution Strategies

{sync-service} allows developers to define custom conflict resolution strategies. You can provide custom conflict resolution strategies to the client in the config by using the provided `ConflictResolutionStrategies` type. By default developers do not need to pass any strategy as `UseClient` is the default. Custom strategies can also be used to provide different resolution strategies for certain operations:

[source,javascript]
----
let customStrategy = {
  resolve = (base, server, client, operationName) => {
    let resolvedData;
    switch (operationName) {
      case "updateUser":
        delete client.socialKey
        resolvedData = Object.assign(base, server, client)
        break
      case "updateRole":
        client.role = "none"
        resolvedData = Object.assign(base, server, client)
        break
      default:
        resolvedData = Object.assign(base, server, client)
    }
    return resolvedData
  }
}
----

This custom strategy provides two distinct strategies to be used when a conflict occurs. They are based on the name of the operation to give developers granular control. To use this custom strategy pass it as an argument to conflictStrategy in your config object:

[source,javascript]
----
let config = {
...
  conflictStrategy: customStrategy
...
}
----

== Listening to Conflicts

{sync-service} allows developers to receive information about the data conflict that occurred between the client and the server.

When a conflict occurs {sync-service} will attempt to do a field level resolution of data - meaning it will check all fields of your type to see if both the client or server has changed the same field. The client can be notified in one of two scenarios.

If both client and server have changed any of the same fields then the `conflictOccurred` method of your `ConflictListener` will be triggered.

If the client and server have not changed any of the same fields and the data can be easily merged then the `mergeOccurred` method of your `ConflictListener` will be triggered.

Developers can supply their own `conflictListener` implementation

[source,javascript]
----
class ConflictLogger implements ConflictListener {
  conflictOccurred(operationName, resolvedData, server, client) {
    console.log("Conflict occurred with the following:")
    console.log(`data: ${JSON.stringify(resolvedData)}, server: ${JSON.stringify(server)}, client: ${JSON.stringify(client)}, operation:  ${JSON.stringify(operationName)}`);
  }
  mergeOccurred(operationName, resolvedData, server, client) {
    console.log("Merge occurred with the following:")
    console.log(`data: ${JSON.stringify(resolvedData)}, server: ${JSON.stringify(server)}, client: ${JSON.stringify(client)}, operation:  ${JSON.stringify(operationName)}`);
  }
}

let config = {
...
  conflictListener: new ConflictLogger()
...
}
----

== Pre-Conflict Errors

{sync-service} provides a mechanism for developers to check for a 'pre-conflict' before a mutation occurs. It does this out of the box by checking whether or not the data being sent conflicts locally. This happens when a mutation (or the act of creating a mutation) is initiated and before being sent new data arrives via subscriptions.

An example of when this is useful could be when a user performs the following actions:

. Open a form on their device
. Begin working on the pre-populated data on this form
. Whilst working the client receives new data from the server via subscriptions
. The client is now conflicted but the user is unaware.
. When the user presses submit {sync-service} notices that their data is conflicted and provides the developer with a way to warn the user.

To use this feature, and therefore potentially save unecessary round-trips to the server with data which is definitely conflicted, developers can make use of the error returned by {sync-service}. An example of how developers can use this error can be seen below.

[source,javascript]
----
return client.offlineMutation({
  ...
}).then(result => {
  // handle the result
}).catch(error => {
  if (error.networkError && error.networkError.localConflict) {
    // handle pre-conflict here by potentially
    // providing an alert with a chance to update data before pressing send again
  }
})
