= Configuring and Running Builds for a {mobile-client}

The *Builds* tab in the {mobile-client} view allows you to view the previous builds of the app, and triggers a new build of the app.

== Provisoning a {digger-service} Service

In order to build the {mobile-client} app, you first need to provision a {digger-service} service. If the service is not provisioned, use the link provided on the screen to browse all the available mobile services and provision a new {digger-service} service.

For more details about how to provision the {digger-service} service, please check xref:mobile-cicd.adoc[{digger-service} service guide].

== Creating a Build

After the {digger-service} service is provisioned, you need to create a new build config for the {mobile-client}. You need to provide more information about the mobile app here depending on the platform. For example, the repo of the source code, the type of the build, the keys used to sign the app etc.

For more information about how to configure the build config, please check xref:mobile-cicd.adoc#build-config[the build config section of {digger-service}].

== Starting a Build

Once a build is configured, you can start a new build. You will be able to view the progress of the build from the OpenShift UI and access the full build log.
