=== Managing registered device

The details view of a specific variant shows a list of the registered devices at the bottom:

image::ups-admin-devices1.png[Device list]

The table shows the metadata of each device, including the device token, subscribed categories or - if present - the used alias. On this screen you could also exclude a specific device from receiving Push Notifications, by unchecking the _Receiving_ check-box.

=== Sending a Push Notification from code

While sending a Push Notification from the AdminUI is a nice feature, in a real world scenario, the Push Notification is triggered by a backend. Due to its RESTful architecture any backend, written in any language that supports HTTP(S), can link:../../../specs/aerogear-unifiedpush-rest/sender/index.html[send Push Notification requests] to it. On the details page of a PushApplication you find the required +Server URL+ and credentials (+Application ID+ and +Master Secret+).

WARNING: Due to security reasons the +Application ID+ and the +Master Secret+ should be never stored on a mobile device! Push Notification requests should _never_ be triggered directly from a mobile device.

=== PushApplication Analytics

The Unified Push Server provides some metrics and analytics which are presented on a dasboard :

image::ups-admin-analytics-clean.png[Push Activity]

The upper part shows some *key* numbers :

* _Push Messages_ : The total number of push messages sent to UnifiedPush Server for dispatching to registered devices.
* _Notification Dispatched_ : The total number of notifications dispatched via Push Networks to registered devices.
* _Notifications Opened_ : Number of notifications that were delivered to registered device and opened by a user.
* _Average Open Rate_ : The result of _Notifications Opened_ / _Notifications Dispatched_

The _Performance_ chart show for each Push Notification the number of targeted devices, the number of opened apps. The x-axis legend shows the _alert_ value of the Push Notification payload.

Finally, the _Push Networks_ chart shows the split between the different Push Networks.

To get the _Notifications Opened_ metric activated, it needs to be "turned on" on the different client SDKs :

* For iOS, please refer to link:https://aerogear.org/docs/specs/aerogear-ios-push/Classes/AGPushAnalytics.html[this document].
* For Android, please check the _org.jboss.aerogear.android.unifiedpush.metrics_ package  in link:https://aerogear.org/docs/specs/aerogear-android-push/[the JavaDoc].
* For Cordova, please refer to the _Metrics_ section of link:https://aerogear.org/docs/guides/aerogear-cordova/AerogearCordovaPush/[this document].

NOTE: The collected metadata and payload is _automatically_ deleted after 30 days, using a nightly job within the Unified Push Server.

=== PushApplication Activity

On the _Activity log_ tab of a PushApplication you see a list of Push notifications that have been sent to the server:

image::ups-admin-activity1.png[Push Activity - Details]

Each Push Notification can be expanded to see parts of the payload. While being in this view and opening the link:#_sending_a_push_notification[Send Push Notification] Dialog to send a Push Notification, you will see the __Pending...__ status afterwards, until the message was delivered to all involved 3rd party Push Networks:
