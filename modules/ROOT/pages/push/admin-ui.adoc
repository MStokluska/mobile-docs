=== Managing registered device

The details view of a specific variant shows a list of the registered devices at the bottom:

The table shows the metadata of each device, including the device token, subscribed categories or - if present - the used alias. On this screen you could also exclude a specific device from receiving Push Notifications, by unchecking the _Receiving_ check-box.

=== PushApplication Activity

On the _Activity log_ tab of a PushApplication you see a list of Push notifications that have been sent to the server:

Each Push Notification can be expanded to see parts of the payload. While being in this view and opening the link:#_sending_a_push_notification[Send Push Notification] Dialog to send a Push Notification, you will see the __Pending...__ status afterwards, until the message was delivered to all involved 3rd party Push Networks:

NOTE: The collected metadata and payload is _automatically_ deleted after 30 days, using a nightly job within the Unified Push Server.
