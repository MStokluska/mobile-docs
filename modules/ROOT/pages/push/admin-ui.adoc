=== Managing registered device

The details view of a specific variant shows a list of the registered devices at the bottom:

image::ups-admin-devices1.png[Device list]

The table shows the metadata of each device, including the device token, subscribed categories or - if present - the used alias. On this screen you could also exclude a specific device from receiving Push Notifications, by unchecking the _Receiving_ check-box.

=== Importing Device Metadata

For various reasons, e.g. migrating from a custom solution to the Unified Push Server, it is possible to import devices and their metadata, including their devicetoken, into a variant. This is possible via cURL and on the UI. For that, on a specific variant, click on the _More_ menu you have the choice to select the _Import_ option.

The following dialog allows you to upload a JSON file, containing the device metadata.

NOTE: The API for the JSON importer is described link:https://www.aerogear.org/docs/specs/aerogear-unifiedpush-rest-1.0.x/registry/device/importer/index.html#POST[here].

=== Exporting Device Metadata

Similar, the Unified Push Server has an option to export the device metadata of a variant. This is handy when you want to move from one Unified Push Server instance to a different one. On the _More_ menu of a specific variant, you have the choice to select the _Export_ option.

Starting the export will generate a JSON file, which is being downloaded to your machine.

=== Sending a Push Notification from code

While sending a Push Notification from the AdminUI is a nice feature, in a real world scenario, the Push Notification is triggered by a backend, as explained in link:#_server_integration_tutorials[Server Integration Tutorials].

The Unified Push Server comes with APIs for link:../../../unifiedpush/GetStartedwithJavaSender/[Java] and link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-nodejs-client#examples[Node.js]. Due to its RESTful architecture any backend, written in any language that supports HTTP(S), can link:../../../specs/aerogear-unifiedpush-rest/sender/index.html[send Push Notification requests] to it. On the details page of a PushApplication you find the required +Server URL+ and credentials (+Application ID+ and +Master Secret+).

For the supported SDKs the Unified Push Server has a feature to generate code snippets for the backend part as well:

image::ups-admin-send3.png[Backend push integration]

WARNING: Due to security reasons the +Application ID+ and the +Master Secret+ should be never stored on a mobile device! Push Notification requests should _never_ be triggered directly from a mobile device.

The visible Java code above can be used in any JavaSE or JavaEE application that needs to send Push Notification requests to the Unified Push Server, like shown in the diagram below:

image::ups-admin-sending-sd.png[Sending Push from Backend]

Besides Java, the UI contains snippets for Node.js and cURL.

=== PushApplication Analytics

The Unified Push Server provides some metrics and analytics which are presented on a dasboard :

image::ups-admin-analytics-clean.png[Push Activity]

The upper part shows some *key* numbers :

* _Push Messages_ : The total number of push messages sent to UnifiedPush Server for dispatching to registered devices.
* _Notification Dispatched_ : The total number of notifications dispatched via Push Networks to registered devices.
* _Notifications Opened_ : Number of notifications that were delivered to registered device and opened by a user.
* _Average Open Rate_ : The result of _Notifications Opened_ / _Notifications Dispatched_

The _Performance_ chart show for each Push Notification the number of targeted devices, the number of opened apps. The x-axis legend shows the _alert_ value of the Push Notification payload.

Finally, the _Push Networks_ chart shows the split between the different Push Networks.

To get the _Notifications Opened_ metric activated, it needs to be "turned on" on the different client SDKs :

* For iOS, please refer to link:https://aerogear.org/docs/specs/aerogear-ios-push/Classes/AGPushAnalytics.html[this document].
* For Android, please check the _org.jboss.aerogear.android.unifiedpush.metrics_ package  in link:https://aerogear.org/docs/specs/aerogear-android-push/[the JavaDoc].
* For Cordova, please refer to the _Metrics_ section of link:https://aerogear.org/docs/guides/aerogear-cordova/AerogearCordovaPush/[this document].

NOTE: The collected metadata and payload is _automatically_ deleted after 30 days, using a nightly job within the Unified Push Server.

=== PushApplication Activity

On the _Activity log_ tab of a PushApplication you see a list of Push notifications that have been sent to the server:

image::ups-admin-activity1.png[Push Activity - Details]

Each Push Notification can be expanded to see parts of the payload. While being in this view and opening the link:#_sending_a_push_notification[Send Push Notification] Dialog to send a Push Notification, you will see the __Pending...__ status afterwards, until the message was delivered to all involved 3rd party Push Networks:
