= Monitoring {unifiedpush-service} Activity

{unifiedpush-service} collects metadata and payload, and this is accessed using {unifiedpush-service} Activity screen.

IMPORTANT: {unifiedpush-service} *automatically* deletes the collected metadata and payload after 30 days by an out-of-hours batch job.

The Activity screen can been seen in the following image:
